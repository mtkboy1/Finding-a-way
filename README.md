# Finding-a-way
Finding a way "stupid" algorithm
# How
It remembers the previous position and based on possible forks (map.java ), goes on (he goes through all the options until he finds the "best" one)
# Instruction manual
When you log into the app, you can see 3 input fields and 2 buttons. The "from" input field tells you where you're going to navigate from (always start at 0). The "to" input field is the field where you are paving the way. The "Result" input field, contrary to expectations, is the place where you need to pave the way. The "add" button adds these paths. The "run" button launches them.
